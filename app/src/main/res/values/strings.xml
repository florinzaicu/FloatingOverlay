        This application displays a floating overlay with controls that allow changing the system
        volume. The application uses a foreground task to show the overlay. The floating overlay and
        service can be closed by pressing the exit button on the overlay itself (expanded view) or
        by pressing the close button displayed on the persistent foreground service notification.
        \n\n
        The overlay can be expanded by long pressing on the gesture icon. A single press on the gesture
        icon will increase the volume, while a double press will decrease it. The overlay can be
        flicked over to a side of the screen by preforming a horizontal flick gesture on the drag icon.
        \n\n
        The overlay may also be manually moved on screen via the drag icon (expanded view).
        \n\n
        To show the overlay, press the show overlay button.
